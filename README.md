Hello, I'm Sebastian. I spent my first 18 years in Brooklyn, NY, and am now in the middle of my 2nd at Northeatsern University in Boston. I'm drawn to projects that combine creativity with technical rigour. Outside of school, the interests that consume most of my attention include running, film, basketball, music, and mindfulness.
