### Hello, I’m Sebastian.
I’m a Business and Data Science major at Northeastern University. 

I believe that data is the best tool we humans have for cutting through noise, shaping better outcomes discovering what's true.

I want to deeply understand this tool, and use it to solve problems and create rather than extract value.
